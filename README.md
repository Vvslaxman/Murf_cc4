# Murf_cc4

Excellent — that’s exactly the mindset that wins coding challenges and builds something truly **meaningful**.



# 🧠 Goal: Solve a Real-World Problem Using Voice + Social Media

Let’s define **a sharp, impactful problem**, then build a **voice-driven solution** around it using Murf, social media websites, and possibly accessibility tools.


## 💡 PROBLEM STATEMENT

 **"Social media is visually overwhelming and inaccessible to users with visual impairments, screen fatigue, or attention disorders. There’s no unified, cross-platform way to consume social media passively using voice."**



## 🔥 YOUR SOLUTION:

- A **Voice Assistant for Social Media** that:

* **Reads out new posts, DMs, or notifications aloud** using Murf’s TTS
* Works across **WhatsApp Web, Instagram, LinkedIn, and more**
* Helps:

  * Visually impaired users
  * People suffering from digital eye strain
  * Multitaskers who want to listen to updates while doing other things
* Acts like an **audio feed of your social life**

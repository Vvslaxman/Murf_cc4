# SocialCast Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels) 
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Creating Icons

You can create simple placeholder icons using any image editor or online tool. The icons should represent the SocialCast concept (podcast/microphone theme).

### Quick Icon Creation

1. Use a simple microphone or podcast icon
2. Use a gradient background (blue to purple to match the popup theme)
3. Export in the required sizes: 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixels
4. Save as PNG format

### Online Tools

- [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) - Generate favicons from text or images
- [Canva](https://canva.com) - Free online design tool
- [GIMP](https://gimp.org) - Free image editor

### Icon Requirements

- Format: PNG
- Sizes: 16x16, 48x48, 128x128 pixels
- Style: Should match the extension's modern, professional look
- Colors: Blue/purple gradient to match the popup theme

## Temporary Solution

For now, you can use any existing icon files or create simple colored squares as placeholders. The extension will work without proper icons, but they improve the user experience.
